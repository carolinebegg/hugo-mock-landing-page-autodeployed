## CIS 3500 Homework #2

### PART II: Automating the Deployment of a Hugo Website (hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed)

Summary of PART II Tasks + Additional Practice

1. Import hugo-mock-landing-page repository
2. Adjust baseURL in config.toml file
3. Configure repository settings for privacy and where to publish to
4. Add a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment of the landing page
5. Produce line-by-line explanation from Claude
6. Verified the website's deployment
7. Verified the website's deployement after properly updating a change

In addition to creating and customizing the landing page framework, I wanted to expand more fully upon the site and to get more practice with Hugo; thus, I decided to customize three of the featured posts on the website. I think that this definitely added to the overall completeness and quality of my landing page, as well as helped me to gain some more practical experience in building a webpost with Hugo.
